<h3>MOVIEGUESS</h3>
<p>
In this java based game, you will be provided with a complete dashed name of a movie. </p>
<p>
The user then gets ten chances, to input a character, which he thinks occurs in the name of a movie. If the movie indeed had a character, then in the dashed movie name,
would be replaced by the true character at all occurences.
</p>
However if the character is wrong, then a chance would be deducted. 
<br>
<b>Beware</b> you have only ten chances.
<p>
Running the program in IntelliJ is shown below

<h3>Winning Method</h3>
<p>Above image depicts, winning by giving input to a single character before guesses run out.<br>
But there is also, an another way, suppose if you know the full movie, and you are bored to type single character, then all you had to do is type 1 as input. The terminal than will
tell you to input the complete name of the movie. If the movie matches then you win otherwise you would loose. It is shown below.
